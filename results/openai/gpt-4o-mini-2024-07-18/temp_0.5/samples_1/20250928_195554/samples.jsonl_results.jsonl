Here's the complete implementation of the `triangle_area` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of\n    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. \n    Otherwise return -1.\n    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater \n    than the third side.\n    \n    Example:\n    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00\n    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1\n    '''\n    # Check for valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem\n    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:\n        # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n        s = (a + b + c) / 2\n        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n        return round(area, 2)\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The function first checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, the function returns `-1`.\n2. **Heron's Formula**: If the triangle is valid, it calculates the semi-perimeter `s` and then uses Heron's formula to compute the area.\n3. **Rounding**: Finally, the area is rounded to two decimal places before being returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00\nprint(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Output: -1\n```", "result": "failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 13)", "passed": false}
